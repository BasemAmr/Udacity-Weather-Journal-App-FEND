# Udacity-Weather-Journal-App-FEND

### index.html File
It is the same design that was provided by Udacity, I only added an ```id``` attribute to the ```Most Recent Entry``` div

### styles.css File
I changed the page style to look nice for me

### app.js File
It is the first main file, I get the OpenWeatherMap API data then post these data and update user interface dynamically

### server.js File
The second main file... First, I import modules that I will use (```express``` ```body-parser``` ```cors```)
after this I wrote ```get``` and ```post```routes to get data and post it.

### How to run
install node.js on your device, install modules ```express``` ```body-parser``` ```cors``` by using ```npm install module_name``` then run the local server by writing this line in your powershell ```node server.js``` and open your favourite web browser and type: localhost:5050 .
